# Quiz Website Application

During the first lockdown of 2020, hosting a quiz over zoom was the next big thing to do. I wanted to create a simple web application that could generate a quiz quickly. Using the Open Trivia Database for the data and jQuery to build everything on the frontend.

Future features for the project is to add the ability to generate a custom quiz based on certain parameters and also create a scoreboard that will allow players to track their score when theyâ€™re playing a game.
